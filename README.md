MMChat aims to combine current cutting-edge technologies and published big language models to build a dynamic and interactive multi-modal platform, covering vision, language, 3D, text processing and other aspects of processing. Among them, MMChat includes facial recognition, audio command classification and recognition, gesture detection, big language model interaction, 3D stereo perception and many other technologies. And this repo provides an integrated GUI interface based on the tkinter framework, which is convenient for users to use. If you have the opportunity in the future, you can try to deploy the code and model on the end-side device for intelligent information perception testing.
